    "## Introduction\n",
    "Just as you previously used the t-distribution to provide confidence intervals for estimating the population mean, you can also use similar methods to test whether two populations are different, statistically speaking. To do this, you can use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a one sample t-test and make conclusions about an experiment based on the results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function in Python `one_sample_ttest(sample, popmean, alpha)` that will take in sample data (an array of observations), the population mean and the alpha value to calculate and print out the t-statistic, critical t-value, and p-value for the sample and identify if the results are significant or not. The function should also create a visualization using `seaborn` of the distribution to check for normality."

    "\n",
    "In this lab, you saw a quick introduction to hypothesis testing using frequentist methods with t-values and p-values. You saw how a one sample t-test can be applied to contexts where the population mean is unknown and you have a limited amount of sample data. You looked at all the stages required for such hypothesis testing with a description of steps and also, how to perform these functions in Python. The lesson also briefly explains the comparison of using p-value for statistical significance vs. effect sizes. "
